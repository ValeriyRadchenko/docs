## Create a Rule to Assign Roles

<%= include('../_includes/_authorization-create-rule') %>

## Restrict Access to Secure Content

To restrict secure content to users with a role of `admin`, subscribe to `$stateChangeStart` event.

```js
// components/auth/auth.service.js
(function () {

  function authService($rootScope, lock, authManager, $q) {
	
    $rootScope.$on('$stateChangeStart', function(event, nextRoute) {
      if (nextRoute.controller === 'AdminController') {
        if (!isAdmin()) {
          alert('You are not allowed to see the Admin content');
          return event.preventDefault();
        }
      }
    });
	
  }
})();
```

Create a new `Admin Content` in the `admin` template:

```html
<!-- components/admin/admin.html -->
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h2 class="text-center"><img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/styleguide/1.0.0/img/badge.svg"></h2>
  <h2 class="text-center">Admin</h2>
  <div class="text-center">
    <h2>You are viewing this because you are logged in and you have 'admin' role</h2>
  </div>
</div>
```

Every time the `$stateChangeStart` event fires we check if the user is an admin using a new `isAdmin` function added to the `authService`. This method checks if the `roles` attribute of `app_metadata` added by the rule contains `admin`.

<blockquote>
Note: Users have no control over their own app_metadata, so there is no risk of a user modifying their own access level in Auth0. Keep in mind, however, that the payload of a JSON Web Token can be modified in debuggers such as jwt.io. If a user does this, their JWT will be invalidated and become unusable for accessing server resources. They would, however, be able to access client side routes with a modified payload. Be sure to keep sensitive information out of the client side and rely on XHR requests for that information as this will ensure that resources are properly protected."
</blockquote>

```js
// components/auth/auth.service.js
(function () {

  function authService($rootScope, lock, authManager, $q) {

    function isAdmin() {
      return userProfile && userProfile.app_metadata
        && userProfile.app_metadata.roles
        && userProfile.app_metadata.roles.indexOf('admin') > -1;
    }
	
  }
})();
```

Now if an user logs in with an email that contains `@example`, they will be allowed access to the /admin route.
